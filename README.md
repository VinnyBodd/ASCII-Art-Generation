This  program  will convert gif images into sequences of ASCII characters that, when printed to the console, approximate the original image.

In AsciiArtUtil: After the ascii art has been created the image can be; 
 -flipped horizontally or vertically,
 -rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise,
 -invert the image (i.e., make the ASCII art "negative" of the image), and
 - save the new image with the same filename as the original image and then end the program.
